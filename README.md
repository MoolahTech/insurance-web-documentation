# Documentation for the web SDK for insurance

The Insurance SDK can be used to offer various insurance products to customers by partners. The data collection, handling and communication with the insurance provider is handled by Savvy. Savvy also generates receipts, which are used as temporary policies until the final policy is issued, which are sent over email / whatsapp to the end customer. Savvy *does not* handle claim processing; for this we provide dedicated communication channels to the insurance company (email & phone number) for the end customer to use.

Savvy Environments:

Sandbox
https://www.thesavvyapp.in

Production
https://api.savvyapp.in

To use the SDKs, you have to first get access to your access key and secret key. Request your SPOC for these credentials. Staging credentials will be given first, and then production credentials will be issued once a round of testing has been performed. The API urls will also be shared via your SPOC.
**The secret key must be kept secret**. Please make sure this key is not on the phone, or anywhere in your database or permanent storage. It must be kept in your live environment as a env. variable or use other similar key storage mechanisms like AWS KMS. Leakage of your secret key could compromise all your users and could lead to very bad things.

## User creation

Every request from the SDK to the our API must be authenticated using your access key (which identifies the partner making the request) and an IDENTITY_TOKEN (which identifies the user making the request). A user must be created via a server-to-server call using your access and secret key. In return, an expiring token is passed back. Please store this token SAFELY, preferably in the android keystore or other similar storage mechanism and pass it to the SDK.
